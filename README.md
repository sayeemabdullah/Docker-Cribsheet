# Docker-Cribsheet

> I just started learning **Docker** so this is just a small initiative to make a crib sheet that may help me or anyone else in the future. You can check out my [CSS Cribsheet](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/CSS-Cribsheet) and [React-Cribsheet](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/React-Cribsheet).


## Installation

To install we need to run the following command:

``` bash

$ sudo apt install docker.io

```

To check we can run the following command:

``` bash

sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay github.com/sayeemabdullah

```

If the installation was completed successfully we will see a whale saying “github.com/sayeemabdullah”.
